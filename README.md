Image-Based Information Retrieval API

Overview
The Image-Based Information Retrieval API is a powerful solution designed to automatically extract text from images. Leveraging Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and advanced AI-based image analysis technologies, this API handles a variety of image formats and text content types, including printed, handwritten, and stylized text.

Features

Image File Input: Accepts common image formats such as JPEG, PNG, and TIFF.
Text Extraction: Utilizes OCR to detect and transcribe text from images, accommodating different font styles, sizes, and orientations.
Output and Formatting: Provides transcribed text in clear, structured formats including plain text, JSON, or CSV. Includes metadata like text location and confidence level.

Key Functionalities

Image File Input:
Upload images directly for transcription.
Supports multiple image formats.
Text Extraction:
Extracts text from images with various fonts and orientations.
Handles multi-language text, complex layouts, and mixed content.
Output and Formatting:
Returns text in plain text, JSON, or CSV formats.
Includes metadata such as text location and confidence level.

Technical Specifications:
Accuracy: Focus on high transcription accuracy, even for challenging text formats.
Performance: Efficiently processes images of different sizes and resolutions.
Scalability: Handles multiple image transcription requests simultaneously.
Documentation: Comprehensive setup and usage instructions.
